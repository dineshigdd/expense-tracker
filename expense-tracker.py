main()

# or you can do as follows

# you can use the __name__ variable to determine if a Python script is being run as the main program or if it is being imported as a module (code written in another Python file).

# If the value of __name__ is set to '__main__', it implies that the current script is the main program, and not a module.

# As a final step, create an if statement to check if __name__ == '__main__', and move the main() call inside this block.

# if __name__ ==  '__main__' :
# 	main()
